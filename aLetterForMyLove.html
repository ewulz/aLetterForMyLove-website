<h1> Hello honey, I missed you.</h1>
<p>
    I wish I could be by your side. 
<p> I want you to know that loving you was the best thing I cherished.
</p>
    I'll wait for the moment of us being comfortable with each other, 
    
<p>having each other's back, and telling each other what upset us or what makes us uncomfortable.
    
</p> 
    I accept the fact that I'm not yet better. I want you to stay.  
</p>
    I want you to wait and see until I become better. 
<p> I want you to experience special treatment like what others experienced. 
</p>
    You deserve better, you deserve me and my (becoming better) side. 
<p>
    Just like wave to earth, "I'll be with you on your ride". 
<p> You're mine. You are my sunlight, and I rely on you.
</p>I'm nothing without you, honey. 
<p> Thank you for staying and please, keep loving me.
</p> I want you to experience everything you wanted in love.
