<h1><em> Hello honey, I missed you.</em></h1>

    <em>I wish I could be by your side.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I want you to know that loving you was the best thing I cherished.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I'll wait for the moment of us being comfortable with each other,</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>having each other's back, and telling each other what upset us or what makes us uncomfortable.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I accept the fact that I'm not yet better. I want you to stay.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I want you to wait and see until I become better.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I want you to experience special treatment like what others experienced.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>You deserve better, you deserve me and my (becoming better) side.</em><br>
    <em>     <br>    </em>
    <em>Just like wave to earth, "I'll be with you on your ride".</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>You're mine. You are my sunlight, and I rely on you.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I'm nothing without you, honey.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>Thank you for staying and please, keep loving me.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I want you to experience everything you wanted in love.</em><br>
    <em> <br> </em>
    <em>I love you so bad and I miss you.</em><br>
